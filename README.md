# Streamlined Red Team Infrastructure Automation

## Project Summary:

**UrsaOps** is a dedicated endeavor aimed at simplifying red teaming exercises. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, this project offers a systematic and automated approach to deploying and provisioning a cohesive red team infrastructure.

## Core Objectives:

**Automated Deployment**: Utilize the consistency and repeatability of IaC to efficiently set up the red team environments, reducing potential human errors and inconsistencies.

**Stealth Operations**: Operating with discretion, UrsaOps aims to conduct activities without drawing unnecessary attention.

**Scalability**: Suitable for various scopes, UrsaOps is designed to cater to both compact tasks and broader adversarial simulations.

**Flexibility**: With the ever-evolving threat landscape, our infrastructure is built to adapt and evolve as needed.

**Secure Communication**: UrsaOps emphasizes maintaining encrypted and secure channels, safeguarding the operations' integrity and confidentiality.

## Requirements:
- Terraform: Responsible for the automated provisioning of infrastructure. [Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- Ansible: Used for configuration management and application deployment. [Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)
- Python Libraries
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before executing any of the following steps, ensure you've installed all the Requirements.

- **Set Environment Variable**
  
  Set an environment variable URSAOPS_ROOT pointing to the root directory of your project.
```bash
  export URSAOPS_ROOT="/path/to/UrsaOps"
```
- **Generate Ansible Variables, Terraform Files, & Deploy**

  Generate necessary variables for Ansible configurations based on the given input and initiate the deployment process of the red team infrastructure. You will be prompted to confirm deployment. Enter "y" to continue.
```bash
  python3 main.py deploy operator_input.yml
```
- **Start Provisioning**

  Begin the provisioning process to set up the infrastructure based on the configurations provided.
```bash
  python3 main.py provisioning
```
- **Destroy**

  Clean up and remove the deployed infrastructure.
